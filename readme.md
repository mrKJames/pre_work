# Welcome to year one IBCS!
![welcome](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/217/040/48ACD.png)

This guide will take you through the basics of getting your computer ready for the course. The advanced options are there in case you want to go above and beyond. Everyone will be at a different level coming into the course. It is alright to know nothing and it is alright to know a lot. I have designed the start of the year to even the playing field so to speak. So, be happy where you are, and know you will learn!


## Download Atom:

This will be your IDE for the course. An IDE stands for integrated development environment. Atom is where you will write and run your code. Where you write your code we will call a text editor, and where you run your code we will call the terminal.

- [atom](https://atom.io/)

## Create a GitHub account
This is where you will store your code and share/build with other. You just need to create an account for now.


![git](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/open_graph/github-octocat.png)
Make sure you keep it professional. This is how the whole programming world will know you
- [github](https://github.com/)


# Choose Your Own Adventure 
## If you have never used the terminal, you should work via [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). Just do the nav lesson and know the following and you are all set!

- navigate in the terminal  		(cd)
- create folders					(mkdir)
- create files 						(touch)
- remove folders/files      		(rm)
- run a ruby and python program
- what a file path is
- root level

These are the basic building blocks of the course.


## Else, you have programming experience and have used the terminal for more than 3 months, read the rest of this document.

# Advanced Options

For Atom:

- enable teletype
- file-icons
- tokamak-terminal
- and your own theme


### Directories at the root level:
Create the following file structure in a dir on your desktop called year_one_ibcs. Make the following file structure at your year_one_ibcs root level:

- unit_0
- unit_1
- unit_2
- unit_3
- unit_4
- oop
- adt
- api
- networks
- control
- extras

These are all the topics covered in year one.

### Directories within each folder

All directories need the following two folders and one file inside of them
- programming
- projects
- readme.md

we can tell readme.md is a file simply by noting the extension at the end. .md tells us that this is a markdown file. Similarly a .rb means ruby, and .py means python.


# Even More Advanced Options 

## Download homebrew:
- [brew](https://brew.sh/)
This is your package manager. Basically, it is an easy way to download software, stay updated, and manage dependencies.
