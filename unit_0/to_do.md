# Project Initium
What is IBCS? Well, it is meant to teach you about hardware, software, networks, programming, the design cycle, version control, etc. There is a ton of material. So, being organized is key. 


The first key is to ensure organization. The second key is that this is a project-based class. The final key is managing ambiguity. Often times, you will feel lost, confused, and overwhelmed. This is completely normal. All you need to do is accept that this is normal and try your best!

Here are a few key concepts that you will need to keep in mind:

- All programs must have comments
- After each program I will ask you to explain your work in a short paragraph (3-5 sentences)
- You will only have two tests this year. A midterm and a final. Both of which are old IB exams.
- If you give this your all, you will ace the course and IB exam!


### Part One
Create the following file structure in a root dir on your desktop called year_one_ibcs complete using the terminal. If you don't know terminal commands, no worries. That is the goal of this project!

[learn terminal](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
You'll need to know how to:

- Navigate in the terminal
- create folders
- create files
- remove folders/files
- run a ruby and python program
- what a filepath is

#### Directories at root level:
- unit_0
- unit_1
- unit_2
- unit_3
- unit_4
- oop
- adt
- api
- networks
- control
- extras

#### Directories within each unit_nth
- programming
- projects
- notes

### Part Two

Learn to use [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and create a bio in unit_0. You can fill with any information you like. Just make sure to include:

- what you want out of the class
- experience level
- some sort of picture
- a snippet of code that stands out to you (not too long!)


## Policies 

- Life happens, if you are going to turn work in late I need an email 48 hours before the work is due asking for an extension.

- Office hours are a real thing! Many students will need to take advantage of this during the year

- If you need a letter of reference, allow at least seven days for completion
